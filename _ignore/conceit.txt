Player who moves first is randomly selected
First player chooses where to place their base camp
Second player chooses where to place their base camp, then begins first month

Turns work like this:
	Three developments are randomly selected and become active
	Active developments can be used, can give additional actions
	If an additional action is given, an unused development is randomly selected
	Developments which have been used cannot be re-used until next month
		Development effects (for now) have these possibilites:
		-Resources / +Resources
		Destroy a development
		Build a development
		Build a development irregardless of distance
		For remainer of month, other developments effects are changed
		Copy the effect of an adjacent development
		Some allow the user a choice between multiple effects
	Once all developments are used up or the player passes, the player can build
	Building is unlimited, but consumes Food/Material/Treasure
		Building should be done with a function that takes option and cost variables
		Option can be the normal set for the game, could be something specific (if triggered
		by a development effect)
		Cost (for now) could only be normal or none (if triggered by a development effect)
		Normally, developments can only be built next to existing developments
		Some developments require special action to build
		Can build a ship, which sails away
	Once building is finished, the player's month is over
The game ends after month ten
The player with the most ships built wins
In the case of a tie, the player with the most treasures wins, then materials, then food
